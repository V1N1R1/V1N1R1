## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
Hello! My name is Vinicius. Currently, I work in law enforcement and I'm passionate about the field of technology. 
I'm a student and researcher specializing in cybersecurity and data analysis with Python. 
I develop simple and functional solutions through Python coding to contribute significantly to law enforcement.

## 🎯 Repository Objectives
This repository was created to share Python code developed with the aim of helping law enforcement and making it more efficient.
I recognize that I am new to Python development, and the codes available here are simple. Please feel free to collaborate, correct and contact me.
These codes only work on the command line and preferably through Jupyter Notebook.
I emphasize my commitment to individual freedom and respect for the General Data Protection Law. The codes aim to work with data openly available on the internet and help combat crime.

## 🔍 Available Tools
1. 🧑‍🔬 Facial recognition based on a database existing on the user's machine.
2. 🔎 Image comparer to compare two images and confirm if it is the same person.
3. 🌐 Enumerator of devices connected to your home network, checking IP address, MAC address and device manufacturer.
4. 🕵️‍♂️ Public safety event data analyzer. This code extracts data from a .csv table and, after analyzing this data, returns the regions with the highest crime incidence, in addition to generating a heat map.
5. 🔍 Report IP Address Analyzer. This code processes data from a connection report in .html format. After processing the data, the code counts and extracts all IP addresses found in the report, in addition to producing a report with graphs and relevant information about the analyzed IP addresses.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the creators of the open-source libraries used in these codes. Without these tools, the development of my solutions would not have been possible.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
Those interested in contributing or using the tools can contact me via email for more information.

Note that the codes are simple and related to data analysis in Python. I'm not a senior developer, but just a curious researcher in the field who wants to contribute to law enforcement.
